# Mixed Messages

For my "Mixed Messages" portfolio project, my program auto-generates dad jokes. The program sets up a joke with a question to which the user must guess the punchline; if the answer is wrong, the program provides the punchline and rolls on the floor laughing. If the answer is correct, the program expresses disappointment and repeats the process.
